Human boundary: Require user-provided facts and mark unknowns instead of inventing business data. Include output format, review criteria, and escalation boundary in every prompt. Keep human approval for customer, employee, financial, legal, medical, or operational decisions. Do not claim guaranteed traffic, ranking, revenue, hiring, legal, medical, or conversion outcomes. Product requirements must stay traceable to real user evidence and measurable acceptance criteria.
Module order: 2 of 5.
