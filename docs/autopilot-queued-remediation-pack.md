- Verify source target: https://docs.helicone.ai/.

Internal-link fixes:

- Add or explicitly reject public internal link: 第一个 Upwork 小项目怎么报价：新手范围和底价检查 (/blog/first-upwork-project-pricing-checklist).
- Add or explicitly reject public internal link: Vercel 提示环境变量缺失怎么办：新手部署检查流程 (/blog/vercel-env-variable-missing-beginner-guide).
- Add or explicitly reject public internal link: Codex 生成代码后怎么审核：交付前检查清单 (/blog/codex-code-review-delivery-checklist).
- Confirm the link anchor is contextual and does not interrupt the tutorial flow.

Risk checks:

- Confirm the article is still draft, noindex, and humanReviewRequired before any approval action.
- Open official source targets and verify current product names, APIs, limits, pricing-sensitive wording, and workflow boundaries.
- Rewrite or remove any unsupported claim before mark:review.
- Confirm no traffic, ranking, revenue, client acquisition, or guaranteed result claim was introduced.
- Only after human approval, run mark:review manually; publishing still requires separate explicit approval.
- Confirm the candidate owns a distinct search intent: Agent 工具权限控制.
- No close published article found; still confirm the title is not a duplicate promise.
- No close draft/review candidate found.
- Document why this can remain a separate article.
- If both articles stay, add a clear internal-link relationship: pillar, comparison, implementation detail, or troubleshooting follow-up.

Human checklist:

- Review reason: queued sprint item has not entered the current approval remediation packet.
- Review reason: internal-link placement needs human acceptance or rejection.
- Review reason: search-intent wording needs human copy review.
- Review reason: source and fact-check evidence needs human verification.
- Review reason: risk-language checklist needs human sign-off.
- Apply, rewrite, or explicitly reject each search fix before mark:review.
- Open source targets or run equivalent source checks before mark:review.
- Apply or explicitly reject the public internal-link suggestion before mark:review.
- Resolve risk checklist items and remove unsupported claims before mark:review.
- Only after explicit human approval, run: npm run mark:review -- --file=content/blog/agent-tool-permission-safety-guide.mdx --confirm-human
- Publishing remains a separate explicit approval step.
