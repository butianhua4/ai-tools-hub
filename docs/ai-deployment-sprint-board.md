- Wave: 1
- Lane: agent-deployment
- Implementation mode: managed-web-runtime
- Ready for deployment sprint: true
- Publish confirm: not-included

Deployment checks:
- Verify current official docs before touching model names, SDK imports, endpoints, commands, or deployment settings.
- Confirm secret handling keeps API keys, tokens, and credentials out of client-side code and screenshots.
- Require a smoke test, rollback path, log location, and failure triage checklist before review approval.
- Keep status=draft, noindex=true, and humanReviewRequired=true until explicit approval.
- Do not include publish confirm commands in any generated handoff.
- Do not claim traffic, ranking, revenue, latency, benchmark, cost savings, or uptime without measured evidence.
- Confirm tool allowlists, permission boundaries, human approval steps, retries, and audit logs are explicit.

Human review actions:
- Read the candidate as a tutorial, not a product claim; remove any unsupported certainty.
- Check that the title, intro, FAQ, and examples answer broad deployment search intent.
- Use official docs as fact-check sources before any mark:review action.
- Add or verify a beginner-facing failure path for common install, key, runtime, and deployment errors.
- Map the article to one dominant deployment lane so it does not cannibalize adjacent Agent/RAG/model topics.
- Leave mark:review and publish actions to explicit human approval only.
- Review lane-specific risk boundary for agent-deployment.
