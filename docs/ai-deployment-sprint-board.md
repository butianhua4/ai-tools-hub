## Item Review Actions

### Vercel AI Gateway 怎么做多模型接入：OpenAI、Claude、Gemini 和降级

- File: content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx
- Wave: 1
- Lane: api-integration
- Implementation mode: managed-web-runtime
- Ready for deployment sprint: true
- Publish confirm: not-included

Deployment checks:
- Verify current official docs before touching model names, SDK imports, endpoints, commands, or deployment settings.
- Confirm secret handling keeps API keys, tokens, and credentials out of client-side code and screenshots.
- Require a smoke test, rollback path, log location, and failure triage checklist before review approval.
- Keep status=draft, noindex=true, and humanReviewRequired=true until explicit approval.
- Do not include publish confirm commands in any generated handoff.
- Do not claim traffic, ranking, revenue, latency, benchmark, cost savings, or uptime without measured evidence.
- Confirm rate limits, auth, environment variables, request/response validation, and error handling are explicit.

Human review actions:
- Read the candidate as a tutorial, not a product claim; remove any unsupported certainty.
- Check that the title, intro, FAQ, and examples answer broad deployment search intent.
- Use official docs as fact-check sources before any mark:review action.
- Add or verify a beginner-facing failure path for common install, key, runtime, and deployment errors.
- Map the article to one dominant deployment lane so it does not cannibalize adjacent Agent/RAG/model topics.
- Leave mark:review and publish actions to explicit human approval only.
- Review lane-specific risk boundary for api-integration.
- Use source targets: OpenAI API docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs, Vercel AI SDK docs: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs, Anthropic docs: https://docs.anthropic.com.
