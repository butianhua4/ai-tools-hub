Generated at: 2026-06-14T10:39:19.390Z

## Guardrails

- Auto edit articles: false
- Auto mark review: false
- Auto publish: false
- Traffic claim: not-included
- Stop before: Use the pack to perform manual source/search/link/copydesk repair. Mark review only after explicit human approval per file.
- Note: Read-only repair session pack. It turns the current repair progress into concrete manual repair sessions without editing drafts or changing article state.
