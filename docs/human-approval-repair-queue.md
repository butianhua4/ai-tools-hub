# Human Approval Repair Queue

Generated at: 2026-06-23T16:10:56.720Z

This report is read-only. It breaks repair-before-review candidates into task-level work and stops before any status change.

## Guardrails

- Auto edit articles: false
- Auto mark review: false
- Auto publish: false
- Traffic claim: not-included
- Stop before: Do not run mark:review or publish from this queue. Use it to repair drafts, rerun automation, then ask for explicit human approval per file.
- Note: Read-only repair queue for human approval candidates. It turns repair-before-review decisions into task-level work without editing drafts.

### Vercel AI Gateway 怎么做多模型接入：OpenAI、Claude、Gemini 和降级

- File: content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx
- Minimum tasks: 6
- Categories: source-url, source-review, search-intent, internal-link, copydesk, approval-boundary
- Next decision: repair-before-review
- Mark review command after explicit approval: `npm run mark:review -- --file=content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx --confirm-human`
- Publish confirm: not-included

| Priority | Severity | Category | Action | Proof required |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
