# Human Approval Repair Queue

Generated at: 2026-06-14T10:39:17.978Z

This report is read-only. It breaks repair-before-review candidates into task-level work and stops before any status change.

## Guardrails

- Auto edit articles: false
- Auto mark review: false
- Auto publish: false
- Traffic claim: not-included
- Stop before: Do not run mark:review or publish from this queue. Use it to repair drafts, rerun automation, then ask for explicit human approval per file.
- Note: Read-only repair queue for human approval candidates. It turns repair-before-review decisions into task-level work without editing drafts.
