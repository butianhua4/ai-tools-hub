# Search Intent Wave Planner

Generated at: 2026-06-07T04:37:11.653Z

This report is read-only. It expands the current approval packet into a continuous human-review wave queue across broad AI search-intent lanes.

## Guardrails

- Auto edit articles: false
- Auto mark review: false
- Auto publish: false
- Stop before: Each wave still requires explicit human approval before mark:review --confirm-human or publish:articles --confirm.
- Note: Read-only continuous wave planner for human review. It does not modify article status, noindex, review, or publishing state.

## Source Evidence

- Note: The planner uses editorial lane priorities and safe draft evidence only. It does not claim measured keyword volume, impressions, clicks, or traffic.
- Lane map guardrails: {"autoEditArticles":false,"autoMarkReview":false,"autoPublish":false,"note":"Read-only search-intent lane map. Demand scores are editorial prioritization signals from broad query patterns and source review needs, not keyword-volume or traffic data."}
- Approval guardrails: {"autoEditArticles":false,"autoMarkReview":false,"autoPublish":false,"note":"Read-only human approval packet derived from the search-intent lane map. It does not change article status, noindex, or publishing state.","stopBefore":"Run confirm-human or publish confirm commands only after explicit human approval for each file."}
