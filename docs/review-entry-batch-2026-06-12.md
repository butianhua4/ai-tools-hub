# Review Entry Batch 2026-06-12

This batch moves the next public-content work from "topic inventory" into review entry. It does not publish articles and does not change article status automatically.

## Primary Growth Batch

These 3 articles are the current priority because they match broader search demand beyond website deployment:

| Article | File | Status | Noindex | Check result | Review lane |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Agent 部署怎么做：用 Vercel AI SDK 理解工具调用、多步执行和上线检查 | `content/blog/ai-agent-deployment-vercel-ai-sdk-guide.mdx` | draft | true | 100, no warnings | AI Agent deployment |
| 全行业 AI 提示词模板库怎么做：销售、运营、客服、HR、财务和教育都能用 | `content/blog/industry-ai-prompts-template-library-2026.mdx` | draft | true | 100, no warnings | Broad AI prompts |
| 客服 AI 该选什么模型：速度、成本、知识库、转人工和质检 | `content/blog/ai-model-selection-customer-service-guide.mdx` | draft | true | 100, no warnings | Model deployment / customer support AI |

Current automation evidence:

- `docs/publish-readiness-pack.md`: included 3 articles.
- `docs/review-preflight.md`: checked 3, passed 3, failed 0.
- Guardrails: auto publish is false; auto mark review is false.

## Decision

Next action is to manually approve or revise the 3 primary growth articles first. They cover higher-value search lanes:

1. Agent deployment.
2. Broad industry prompt templates.
3. Model selection for customer support AI.

After human approval, only these 3 should be considered for review status. Publishing should still be a separate small batch after another dry run.

## Do Not Skip

- Do not claim traffic until Search Console or Analytics data exists.
- Do not publish drafts directly.
- Do not mark review without reading the article and checking fast-changing official docs.
- Do not let old project positioning leak back into public pages.
