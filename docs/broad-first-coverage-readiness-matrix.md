# Broad First Coverage Readiness Matrix

Generated at: 2026-06-07T10:13:47.476Z

## Guardrails

- Read-only readiness matrix for first-coverage launch candidates. It cross-checks existing automation reports and never edits articles or changes review/publish state.
- Stop before mark:review and publish. Human approval is required for every file.
- Traffic claim: not-included
