## Progress By File

### Vercel AI Gateway 怎么做多模型接入：OpenAI、Claude、Gemini 和降级

- File: content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx
- Lane: ai-deployment
- Primary query: 大模型部署教程
- Open categories: source-url, search-intent, copydesk
- Ready for human approval after repair: false
- Next manual session: source verification first
- Manual mark-review command after explicit approval: `npm run mark:review -- --file=content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx --confirm-human`

| Category | Status | Detail | Next action | Proof required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| source-url | open | 11 source URL remediation action(s) still need human confirmation. | Open each failed source URL manually, replace dead URLs with accessible canonical sources, then rerun automation. | Reviewer confirms final source URLs are canonical or replaced with accessible equivalents. |
| source-review | evidence-ready | Source review evidence is ready, but human confirmation is still required before mark:review. | Human reviewer verifies fast-changing claims against the listed sources. | Reviewer records source/fact-check confirmation and removes unsupported claims. |
| search-intent | open | 2 search-intent weakness(es) remain. | Adjust title, description, opening, heading, or body so the accepted query appears naturally. | Primary query or accepted equivalent appears naturally in title, description, opening, and headings/body. |
| internal-link | resolved | At least one contextual public article link is present. | Keep the contextual public link if it helps the reader. | Draft contains at least one contextual link to a currently published relevant article. |
| copydesk | open | Copydesk warning remediation still needs human acceptance or cleanup. | Resolve or explicitly accept the copydesk warning without weakening guardrails. | Reviewer resolves or explicitly accepts copydesk warning without weakening guardrails. |
| approval-boundary | manual-only | Manual approval boundary is intact and publish confirmation is not included. | Do not run mark:review until explicit human approval per file. | Draft remains status=draft, noindex=true, humanReviewRequired=true until explicit approval. |
