## Repair Sessions

### Vercel AI Gateway 怎么做多模型接入：OpenAI、Claude、Gemini 和降级

- File: content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx
- Manual mark-review command after explicit approval: `npm run mark:review -- --file=content/blog/vercel-ai-gateway-multi-provider-guide.mdx --confirm-human`
- Rerun after repair: `npm run automation:human-approval-repair-queue`, `npm run automation:human-approval-repair-route`, `npm run automation:gate`, `npm run automation:digest`
- Publish confirm: not-included

#### source verification first

- [high] source-url: Verify source URLs and fact-check queries before mark:review.
- [high] source-review: Confirm no traffic, ranking, revenue, benchmark, cost, latency, or stability claim is unsupported.

Proof:

- Reviewer confirms final source URL is canonical or replaces it with an accessible equivalent.
- Reviewer records source/fact-check confirmation and removes unsupported claims.

#### search intent alignment

- [medium] search-intent: Resolve search weakness: no exact search query appears in title.

Proof:

- Primary query or accepted equivalent appears naturally in title, description, opening, and headings/body.

#### public internal link insertion

- [medium] internal-link: Apply or explicitly reject the internal-link suggestion before mark:review.

Proof:

- Draft contains at least one contextual link to a currently published relevant article.

#### copydesk and approval boundary

- [medium] copydesk: Review reason: copydesk warning remediation exists.
- [medium] approval-boundary: Publishing remains a separate explicit approval step.

Proof:

- Reviewer resolves or explicitly accepts copydesk warning without weakening guardrails.
- Draft remains status=draft, noindex=true, humanReviewRequired=true until explicit approval.
