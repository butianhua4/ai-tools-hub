# Public Coverage Gap Decision Pack

Generated at: 2026-06-06T17:03:11.949Z

This report is read-only. It turns public coverage gap preflight warnings into human review decisions and explicit command boundaries.

## Guardrails

- Auto edit articles: false
- Auto mark review: false
- Auto publish: false
- Stop before: Only use these commands after explicit human approval. Never run mark:review --confirm-human or publish:articles --confirm automatically.
- Note: Read-only human decision pack for public coverage gap candidates. It does not edit article content, metadata, status, noindex, review state, or publishing state.

## Per-Item Review Packets

### AI Agent 部署怎么做：用 Vercel AI SDK 理解工具调用、多步执行和上线检查

- File: content/blog/ai-agent-deployment-vercel-ai-sdk-guide.mdx
- Theme: Agent deployment, tool calling, and production workflows
- Wave: 1
- Decision: human-review-ready-with-optimizations
- Risk level: medium
- Stop before: Stop before mark:review and stop before publish. Both require explicit human approval.
- Public link suggestion: Codex 部署 Vercel 前检查什么：上线前清单 (/blog/codex-vercel-deploy-preflight-checklist)

Review focus:

- tool permissions
- multi-step state
- human approval
- observability and fallback paths

Source targets:

- OpenAI Agents docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents
- Vercel AI SDK docs: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs
- LangChain docs: https://python.langchain.com/docs

Suggested optimizations:

- During human review, decide whether the title, description, or opening section should naturally include one search-seed variant.
- Review the suggested public internal link before publishing: Codex 部署 Vercel 前检查什么：上线前清单 (/blog/codex-vercel-deploy-preflight-checklist).
- Decide whether missing subtopics belong in this article or should become separate follow-up drafts.

Human decision checklist:

- Confirm the article is still draft, noindex, and humanReviewRequired before any approval action.

- Decide whether the warning issues must be fixed before mark:review.
- Choose one public internal link suggestion or document why no link should be added.
- Confirm the article does not claim measured traffic, rankings, impressions, clicks, revenue, or income.
