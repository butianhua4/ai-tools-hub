# Human Approval Execution Queue

Generated at: 2026-06-21T01:45:37.955Z

This queue is read-only. It consolidates the next manual approval actions that can increase public article count, while stopping before article edits, mark-review execution, and publish confirmation.

## Guardrails

- Read-only human approval execution queue. It consolidates the next manual review actions but never edits articles, marks review, publishes, or includes publish --confirm commands.
- Stop before: Stop before mark:review until a human approves each file. Stop before publish --confirm; this queue includes publish dry-runs only.
- Traffic claim: not-included

## Publishing Boundary

- currentPublicPublished: 500
- currentPublishableNow: 0
- projectedPublicPublishedAfterImmediateHumanApproval: 503
- publishConfirmCommandsIncluded: 0
